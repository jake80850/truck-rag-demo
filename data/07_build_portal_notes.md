# Build / Reservation portal notes (limited capture)

The “Build your TELO MT1” configurator appears to require JavaScript; non-rendered crawls may return only “Loading”.

From an indexed snippet, the configurator references:
- “Estimated final price” of **$41,520** (noted as subject to change).
- “Price and specifications are subject to change before reservation fulfillment when vehicles become available.”

## Recommendation
If you want this content in your RAG corpus, use a headless browser / JS-rendering crawler to export the configurator’s text, pricing language, deposit details, and configuration option labels into static markdown.

## Suggested RAG tags
- build, configurator, pricing, reservation, disclaimer
