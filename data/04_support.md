# TELO Trucks — Support page documentation

## What’s on the page
- The page includes a “Support” section that appears to load FAQs dynamically (may require browser JS).
- Contact section:
  - “Can’t find what you’re looking for?”
  - Email: **support@telotrucks.com**
  - A “Send message” form is present.

## Notes for RAG ingestion
- If your crawler supports JS rendering, re-capture this page to ingest the FAQ content.
- If you do not have JS rendering, treat this page as a contact endpoint rather than a knowledge source.

## Suggested RAG tags
- support, faq, contact, customer-service
